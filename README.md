# Cloud City Light Theme for VSCode `preview`

## Why is this theme different?

I find most too colourful which I personally find hard to visually parse. My intentions for this theme is to use a lot of neutral tones and sprinkle in brighter colours only when it actually helps. I don't have any specific method for doing this, I just use my _feelings._
