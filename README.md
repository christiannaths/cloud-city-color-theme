# Cloud City Light Theme for VSCode

_Warning: NOT READY FOR PUBLIC USE_

## Why is this theme different?

Well, I'm not sure it is. But here is why I made it: I find most too colourful (yes, that is the proper way to spell colour ðŸ˜‰ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§) which I personally find hard to visually parse. My intentions for this theme is to use a lot of neutral tones and sprinkle in brighter colours only when it actually helps. I don't have any specific method for doing this, I just use my _feelings._
